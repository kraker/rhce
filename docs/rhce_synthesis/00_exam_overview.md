ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

# Copy to all managed nodes
ssh-copy-id user@node1
ssh-copy-id user@node2
ssh-copy-id user@node3

# Test connectivity
ansible all -m ping
```

### Essential Ansible Installation

```bash

sudo dnf install ansible-core

# Verify installation
ansible --version

# Install additional collections
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

### 2. Master the Documentation
- Learn to use `ansible-doc module_name` efficiently
- Practice finding syntax without internet access
- Memorize locations of key information

### 3. Build Muscle Memory
- Practice common patterns until they're automatic
- Create personal cheat sheets for frequent tasks
- Type examples rather than copy-pasting

### 4. Time Management Skills

- Learn common error patterns and solutions
- Practice systematic troubleshooting approaches

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Time Management Mistakes
- Spending too much time on low-point tasks
- Not leaving time for testing and validation
- Getting stuck on debugging instead of moving forward

### Technical Mistakes
- YAML syntax errors (indentation, quotes)
- Incorrect variable precedence assumptions
- Not testing playbooks before considering them complete
- Forgetting to handle error conditions

### Exam Day Mistakes
- Not reading instructions carefully
- Making assumptions about the environment
- Not using available documentation effectively
- Panicking when encountering unexpected issues

## üß† Mental Preparation

### Build Confidence Through Practice
1. **Start Simple**: Master basic tasks before complex ones
2. **Practice Under Pressure**: Set timers for your practice sessions
3. **Learn from Failures**: Every error teaches you something valuable
4. **Build a Toolkit**: Develop go-to patterns for common scenarios

### Exam Day Mindset
- **Stay Calm**: Breathe and think through problems systematically
- **Read Carefully**: Understand exactly what's being asked
- **Test Everything**: Verify your solutions work completely
- **Move Forward**: Don't get stuck on any single problem

## üìñ Essential Commands to Memorize

```bash
# Documentation and help
ansible-doc module_name
ansible-config list
ansible-inventory --list

# Testing and validation  
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
ansible all -m setup

# Debugging
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -v
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --step

# Vault operations
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml

```

## üîó Next Steps

Now that you understand the exam format and requirements:

1. **Set up your lab environment** following the specifications above
2. **Create a study schedule** based on the 7-week plan
3. **Start with [Module 01: Ansible Basics](01_ansible_basics.md)** to build your foundation
4. **Practice daily** - consistency is key to success

Remember: The RHCE exam tests your ability to **do** Ansible automation, not just understand it. Focus on hands-on practice from day one!
