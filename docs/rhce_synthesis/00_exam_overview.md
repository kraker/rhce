## üîó Next Steps

Now that you understand the exam format and requirements:

1. **Set up your lab environment** following the specifications above
2. **Create a study schedule** based on the 7-week plan
3. **Start with [Module 01: Ansible Basics](01_ansible_basics.md)** to build your foundation
4. **Practice daily** - consistency is key to success

Remember: The RHCE exam tests your ability to **do** Ansible automation, not just understand it. Focus on hands-on practice from day one!
